Enjoy these Freebies!


The catacombs was developed by our Jr Dev Lady Grey so all props to her for this amazing work!
Coordinates into the catacombs: 2727.87, -1066.63, -43.29


I have added a second ymap for a cemetry mausoleum to act like the entrance. 
You need to know how to open doors to make this ymap work!
If you know how to open certain map doors, you will need to add these door hashes to open them:

	3472968914,-- St. Demis Cementry Double Door
	986162257,-- St. Demis Cementry Double Door

You don't have to use this ymap, you can plop the entrance coordinates where you want and portal to the spot mentioned above.



If you use the mausoleum ymap, here are the recommended portals:

Enterance (X, Y, Z, H)
2772.35, -1044.93, 46.3, 180.64

Exit (X, Y, Z, H)
2727.87, -1066.63, -43.29, 312.16
