Hi there,
thank you very much for choosing our product.

To install this product you have to meet the following requirements:
 - RedM Server
 - VORP-Based (current build)
 - SQL Database

Step 1: Go into the folder "installation" which is located in root directory of this resource.
Step 2: Upload the visn_telegram.sql onto your database server.
Step 3: Drag all images from "installation/items" into your inventory items folder located in your server resources directory.
Step 4: You can delete the "installation"-folder in the root directory of this resource since you won't need it anymore.
Step 5: Configure the resource to your needs. You can find the configuration file in the root directory under the name "config.lua".
Step 6: Add the auto-start of this script to the server config (ensure visn_telegram). Make sure that you put it below the essentials of the server like inventory and so on.

Now you're ready to go.
Please keep in mind that the script has to be named "visn_telegram". If you rename the resource, it won't work anymore!
