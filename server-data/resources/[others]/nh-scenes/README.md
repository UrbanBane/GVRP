Interactive Scene Creator for RedM & FiveM


# Information
I used to play on NoPixel and I got inspired to make a similar scenes system to what they have, I believe every roleplay server should have a system like this as it's a powerful tool for roleplay. It's very resource friendly and simple to use. Enjoy!

# Setup
It's pretty simple, once you drop the nh-scenes resource into your resources folder just make sure you put

`ensure nh-scenes`

in your server.cfg.

While in your server have your players bind the 3 keys in Settings > Keybindings > FiveM


You can place a scene by pressing the `Place Scene` key on FiveM or the keybinding in "Keys" for Create for RedM (Default: Home) and pressing it again when you are happy with the placement, filling out the information using my other resource [nh-keyboard](https://forum.cfx.re/t/standalone-nerohiro-s-keyboard-v2-now-for-redm-fivem/4778831) and place away!

if you wish not to use my keyboard resource, you can easily hook it up to your own.

You can also toggle the scenes on and off, and delete scenes you are looking at by binding those keys too (or using the defaults for RedM, Default: Delete for Delete, Right Bracket or "]" for Hide).


There is also a logging system to keep track of people posting monkaS stuff, it by default goes to your server folder in textfiles/scenes.txt, which you can obviously change to your servers logging system if needed.
