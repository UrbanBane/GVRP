### VORP_Law
## Prelude
Witness creation based on [RedM-Witnesses](https://github.com/DarrenJDocherty/RedM-Witnesses), which was developed by [Darren](https://github.com/DarrenJDocherty).  
## Description
VORP_Law is intended as a solution for servers that do not want to rely on players alone for in-game law enforcement on their VORP-Powered RedM servers.  
## Dependencies
- [vorp_core](https://github.com/VORPCORE/vorp-core-lua)  
## Done List (Funtional Features)
- Generate witnesses that notify players with the 'police' job. (Thanks [Darren](https://github.com/DarrenJDocherty)!)
## To-Do List (Chronological Order)
- Dynamic wanted levels that are tracked by the server and, thus, inescapable by simply logging off.
- NPC police forces that spawn and track the player, quantity depending on wanted level.
- Bounties that spawn automatically for high wanted levels that are offered to police and bounty hunters.
- Bounties are collectable by killing the target.
- Bounties are collectable by forcibly returning the target to a law establishment for bonus cash.
- Players get jailed when caught or killed by police, time depending on wanted level when caught.
- Players get sent to prison if wanted level is maxed out when caught where they have to do tasks to win.
- Repeat criminals may find wanted levels sticking where they will have to serve time or find other means to lose their wanted level.
